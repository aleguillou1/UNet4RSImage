# U-Net

This repository provides a simple and reliable tool to perform land cover classification using a U-Net model. A tutorial is provided here, but the notebook is flexible and can be adapted to your own datasets, satellite images, and labels. The only requirements are a Python environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks and QGIS.

The method requires as input a .tif image (the number of channels is adjustable), its corresponding label in .tif format, and a shapefile grid (Figure []).
